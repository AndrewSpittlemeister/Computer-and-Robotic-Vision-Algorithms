# Computer-and-Robotic-Vision-Algorithms
Various computer and robotic vision algorithms implemented from scratch.

Note that many of these projects were written in MATLAB using MATLAB Lives Scripts (similar to jupyter notebooks), however GitHub does note render these scripts yet. PDF renders of the scripts are present but for best results, view live scripts in MATLAB.

- Convolutional Filters
  - using gaussian, median, min, and sharpening
- Edges and Thinning
  - using Sobel, Roberts, and Zhang-Suen  
- Hough Transforms
  - finding lines and ellipses
- Iterative Closest Point Algorithm
  - using randomly generated point clouds
- Optical Flow
  - Horn-Schunck Algorithm with Sobel modification and MATLAB's GPU support
- Segmentation and Feature Extraction
  - extracts objects from image and calculates various statistics
